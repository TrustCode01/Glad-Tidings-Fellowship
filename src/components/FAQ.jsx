          <article className="px-4 pb-4">
          To be born again, acknowledge your need for salvation (Romans 3:23), believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose again (John 3:16), confess and repent of your sins (1 John 1:9), and invite Jesus to be your Savior and Lord (Revelation 3:20). This is the beginning of a new life as a child of God (2 Corinthians 5:17). You can pray a simple prayer of faith and surrender to take this step. Let me know if you'd like guidance with that!

          <article className="px-4 pb-4">
          Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior of the world, and the central figure of Christianity. He is both fully God and fully human (John 1:1, 14). Jesus came to earth to teach, heal, and, most importantly, to reconcile humanity to God through His death on the cross and His resurrection. He willingly gave His life as a sacrifice for our sins, offering us forgiveness and eternal life (John 3:16, Romans 5:8). He is often called the Messiah, meaning the "Anointed One," and is the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). Christians follow Him as their Lord and strive to live according to His teachings.

            <p>
            As a Christian, you are called to love God and others (Matthew 22:37-39), follow Jesus’ teachings (1 John 2:6), pray regularly (1 Thessalonians 5:17), study the Bible (Psalm 119:105), live righteously (1 Peter 1:16), serve others and share the Gospel (Matthew 28:19), and connect with a community of believers (Hebrews 10:24-25). It’s a journey of growth, supported by God’s grace and love.

          <article className="px-4 pb-4">
          As a child of God, you have authority over sin through grace (Romans 6:14), power in prayer knowing God hears you (James 5:16), victory over the enemy by resisting him (James 4:7), the ability to claim God’s promises (2 Corinthians 1:20), and the role of representing Christ as His ambassador (2 Corinthians 5:20). This authority comes through faith in Jesus and your identity in Him.
